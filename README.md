<h1>Fall Quarter Projects, 2022</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

These projects were completed through my first quarter at Seattle University. This was my first time coding but it was a great learning experience. We learned to code in C++, emulating board games using Putty, each one with different tasks but just as challenging.

P1: Word Game <br/>
P2: Hi-Ho! Cherry-O <br/>
P3: Chutes and Ladders <br/>
P4: Memory Matching Card Game <br/> 
P5: Monopoly with Seattle University Names <br/>
